# xfce4ongitpod
gitpod.yml script to run a xfce4 session on chrome-remote-desktop.


i "made" this with chatgpt, so sorry if there is some error on the code.

# what works: 

everything usual, i guess.

audio works via pulseaudio (just use "pulseaudio" on the terminal and open pavucontrol)

the disk is persistent, because the /home folder is actually on /workspace/../home-persistent, so you can use it "without limitations"

enjoy.
